NAME
       nmfd - Driver for Razer Naga mice.

SYNOPSIS
       nmfd [ -h --help] [ -n --no-grab]

DESCRIPTION
       nmfd simple driver for the side buttons on a Razer Naga mouse.

       Each event is placed on a new line to stdout.  Lines are formatted as a
       symbol, the button number, and a newline.  If the line  starts  with  a
       plus  (+), then the button has been pressed.  Similarly, the button has
       been depressed if the symbol is a minus (-).  Furthermore, a colon  (:)
       denotes that the button has been held down.  After the symbol, there is
       a number denoting which button on the mouse has been pressed.   Numbers
       1  through  12  represent  the generic buttons on the side of the Razer
       Naga mouse.  Numbers 13 and 14 represent	 the  forwards	and  backwards
       buttons.	  The  forwards	 and backwards do not yet support detection of
       being held down.	 Numbers 16 and 17 are reserved for the left and right
       tilt  functions	on the scrollwheel.  The left, right, and middle click
       buttons on the mouse are not mapped to any number and  will  not	 cause
       any events if pressed.

       If  the	mouse  is  unplugged, nmfd will exit and print "Error: No such
       device" to stderr.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
	      Display a short page of help info.

       -n, --no-grab
	      Keeps nmfd from grabbing the extra buttons on the	 mouse.	  With
	      this  option  enabled, the default of buttons 1 through 9 typing
	      numbers 1 through 9, 10 typing 0, 11 typing minus, and 12 typing
	      equals will be enabled.

EXAMPLES
       In  the	following  example,  the buttons 1 and 3 are pressed in order,
       then the button 3 is pressed and held down.  Finally, the  forward  and
       backward	 buttons  are  pressed in order.  This example requires Driver
       Mode to be set for your mouse in order for  the	forward	 and  backward
       buttons to work.
